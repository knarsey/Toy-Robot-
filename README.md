# Toy-Robot-
For the Toy Robot Simulator Test, I decided to use JAVA to create the application this is due to the fact that I have demostrated the skills
and the knowledge that I have for the programming language in which i have obtained through my tertiary studies and how i can
actually solve problems in a logical manner. Using JAVA, i believe I have fulfilled the essential requirements in order to make the
application functional.
